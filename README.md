# UoN-Bot
An AIML chatbot designed for use by students at the University of Nottingham.

This bot is capable of returning information about bus schedules, availability of publicly usable PCs, staff contact details, and shop opening times. UoN-Bot can also calculate users' current progress in a given module, as well as ascertain whether or not a student can progress to the next stage of their Computer Science degree.

UoN-Bot also has an in-built webcrawler and search engine which index and store the contents of the Computer Science departmental page and make its contents available to the users through a conversational setting.

To run UoN-Bot simply pass server.js as a parameter into the Node.js interpreter and direct your browser to localhost:9000.
