Why study here? Our computer science degrees cover the latest techniques and technologies across the breadth of the subject Our teaching is inspired by world-class research Our graduates go on to careers with world-leading technology companies Our degrees Computer science changes at an incredible speed.
Here at Nottingham we regularly review what we teach and how we teach it and it is taught by people carrying out world-class research, whose interests cover all aspects of computer science.
This research feeds directly into our curriculum, which provides a strong set of core topics and a wide choice of options in both fundamental and applied computing.
See the undergraduate courses and masters courses we offer.
Teaching Your learning is supported by a number of activities, which may include lectures, laboratory sessions, small group tutorials, problem classes, and coursework.
Research-related project work is an important part of all our degrees.

The most interesting thing we do are our group projects, every term we have a new group and a new project to work on, and this really helps to develop not just our technical skills but our software engineering, team-working and management skills.
Stuart Manton, Second Year Computer Science British Computer Society (BCS) Accreditation Our BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree (G400) and BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (G4G7) are accredited by the British Computer Society and part-exemption is granted from the BCS Professional Examination.
Study abroad The School offers students the opportunity to study abroad as an integral part of their studies.
Personal Tutors Each student has a personal tutor who guides their studies and module choices, as well as taking an interest in their personal and academic development.
He or she is the first point of contact for academic matters and you will have regular meetings in the first year and will continue to see him/her throughout your degree.
Listening to students The views of the students voiced through the student/staff body (Learning Community Forum) and in the National Student Survey help to influence the changes to our courses and modules.
We are responding to issues that were apparent in previous years, in particular we are improving our approach to feedback.
Student views on this are being treated as a priority and new policies are in place for the current year.
Some comments returned by our students in the National Student Survey Practical modules provide stimulating course material, and good resources.
Enthusiastic lecturers provided excellent teaching experience.

The facilities are very good.
People are very easy to get hold of to talk to.
The staff are always willing to help you out and so are the tutors.
Technology has always been available; we use very new technology within our course.
Resources are available either in the library or online.
Wonderful staff.
An excellent course.
Time of my life! Course was both mentally and physically challenging which is great and allowed students confidence and skills to increase dramatically.
Group based assessments were an added bonus! The introduction of the subjects from other areas is good.
You are also introduced to new topics of subjects you did not know about already, such as computer science.
I didn't know that there was discrete Mathematics involved in it.
The subjects definitely broadened my horizons.
The course is intensive and stimulating, and it provides a good opportunity for me to understand the subjects well.
Also, the structure of the course is very good.
Overall, I really enjoy my study at the University of Nottingham.
The campuses are beautiful and the staff here are kind.
In addition, I also choose UNUK for my master course.
Teachers are really happy.
The IT facilities in uni are very good and fast.
