Whether it's a semester abroad or the full year, studying abroad offers a broad spectrum of benefits.
Total immersion into new cultures and experiencing learning methods at other world leading universities is not only an amazing event in your life but also something that will make your CV shine under employers' spotlights.
Students in the School of Computer Science have a number of opportunities to spend time studying abroad; whether it be as part of our brand new MSci with an International Year courses, or through the University-wide Study Abroad programme.
There are also opportunities to study on the Malaysia campus through Intercampus exchange.
If you are interested in studying overseas, please contact Daniel Serotsky for advice on how to get those wheels in motion! Study Abroad Fair Each year in November, the University holds a study abroad fair which gives information about the University-wide programme exchange scheme and other opportunities. There will be representatives from our International Office on hand to explain the process.
Graduates who have studied abroad are more appealing to business.
UK graduates are missing out on high-flying international jobs because fewer of them are choosing to study abroad as part of their degree.
The Guardian Student profile - Daniel Allenby I chose to study abroad mainly because I haven’t travelled much in my life; before flying to Australia I’d only been to France one summer.
I wanted to experience more of the world, to travel and enrich myself in new cultures.
I also wanted to challenge myself - I’ve never been the most socially adept when it comes to meeting new people, so I wanted to put myself in a situation where I’d have to meet some new people.
I chose Australia in particular because of the weather and it’s beautiful landscape.
I still can’t believe during the winter temperatures drop to around 20 degrees, which they consider cold - for us that's British barbecue weather! I’ve been in Brisbane for about a month now, which has flown by.
I’ve had the opportunity to do some travelling already thanks to an Australian friend, I’ve visited the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast where the beaches are just amazing.
Lectures have now started though, so I may actually have to do some studying! What has surprised me the most so far is how easily I’ve adapted to living in another country, I expected to be quite home sick, but so far I love it here.
Options for overseas study Studying on an MSci with an International Study Year Applicants to Computer Science at Nottingham are now able to apply for a course with a year's International Study integrated as an element of their degree.
For the first time in 2014, students on our MSci programmes in Computer Science and Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence courses were given the opportunity to study on an approved computer science programme at one of our partner universities.
Currently, we have partnerships with some of the world's top universities in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Mexico and New Zealand.
See our prospectus entries for the MSci with International Study: Computer Science including International Year Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence including International Year The University of Nottingham's Study Abroad Programmes Our links with universities across the globe mean we can offer a variety of study abroad placements.
As well as enabling you to experience a different culture, studying abroad is an excellent opportunity to learn about different approaches to technology.

Such opportunities are normally for the whole of a student's second year of a three-year route of study, and for the whole of a student’s second or third year of a four-year route of study.
